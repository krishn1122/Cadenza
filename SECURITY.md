## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Cadenza seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@cadenza.com** (or your designated security email)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds
- **OAuth Integration**: Google and LinkedIn OAuth 2.0
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and user role separation
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Sequelize ORM with parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All production traffic over HTTPS

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information exposed in error messages
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server side
4. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
5. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
6. **Use HTTPS** in all environments
7. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive data

### For Deployment

1. **Use strong passwords** for all accounts
2. **Enable firewall** and close unnecessary ports
3. **Regular security updates** for the operating system
4. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Backup data** regularly and securely
6. **Use SSL certificates** from trusted authorities
7. **Implement monitoring** and alerting

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

- **Email Restriction**: Currently limited to Gmail addresses only
- **File Upload**: No file upload functionality implemented yet
- **API Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting may need enhancement for high-traffic scenarios
- **Audit Logging**: User action audit logging not fully implemented

### Planned Improvements

- [ ] Enhanced rate limiting with Redis
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Advanced session management
- [ ] File upload with virus scanning
- [ ] API versioning and deprecation handling

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Ensure these security-related environment variables are properly set:

```env
# Strong JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_minimum_32_characters

# Strong session secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_session_secret_key

# Database credentials (strong passwords)
DB_PASSWORD=strong_database_password

# OAuth credentials (keep secret)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_linkedin_client_secret
```

### Database Security

```sql
-- Create dedicated database user with limited privileges
CREATE USER cadenza_user WITH PASSWORD 'strong_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE cadenza TO cadenza_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO cadenza_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO cadenza_user;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO cadenza_user;
```

### Nginx Security Headers

```nginx
# Security headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "no-referrer-when-downgrade" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self' http: https: data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```
